There are several ways to deploy Backend application
Here I am using ElasticBeanstalk and Rds

#create a Rds with mysql and select the free tier options(dont forgot to add the Db name in the Additional configuration while creating Database)
#after succesfully created db gather the Endpoint(Hostname),Master username(username),pwd,dayabase name
#donforgot to add the security groupd inbound rules has all traffic
#try ti use these properties to connect with local My sql workbench to Rds with the above cred
# add those respective prop in the application.prop inside springboot code
#use below formalt if you declared the properites inside Elsaticbeanstlak environemnts while creating it
#spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://${RDS_HOSTNAME}:${RDS_PORT}/${RDS_DB_NAME}
#spring.datasource.username=${RDS_USERNAME}
#spring.datasource.password=${RDS_PASSWORD}

To connect Fe application use their domain name and paste it inside our coreConfig.js like below
// replace below allowed Origins with our domain name as below which you can gegt it inside Aws amplify (Domain name)
                .allowedOrigins("https://your-frontend-domain.com")

#already in the current repo we have workflow file use it if your Aws account is lessthan 12 months otherwise it will be chargeble
